Ok, I have the Strawberry LLM hooked up and need to start incorporating the functional requirements: From my view they are as follows:
1 - UI to turn voice into LLM command (User - "Tell me a story at first year reading level."
2 - Voice to record the user speech as they read aloud the story.
3 - The LLM must determine the reading level of the user based on their speech.
4 - The LLM must then adjust the complexity of the story it generates in real time to match the users reading level.
5 - This app must store the user information at the end of every usage so that the user can start at the same place they stopped.
