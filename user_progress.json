She loved to play in her family's garden every day.\n\nOne sunny morning, Luna saw a colorful butterfly fluttering by. \"I want to catch it!\" she thought. Luna chased the butterfly through the flowers and under the bushes. She ran and ran, having so much fun.\n\nAfter a while, Luna looked around and realized she was lost. The garden seemed big, and Luna felt scared. \"What will I do now?\" she meowed.\n\nJust then, a friendly dog named Max walked by. Max had a wagging tail and a big, warm smile. \"Hello, little kitten. Are you lost?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Luna. \"I was chasing a butterfly and can't find my way home.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" said Max. \"I'll help you.\" Max sniffed the ground and led Luna back through the garden. They passed the big oak tree and the colorful flower beds.\n\nFinally, they reached Luna's cozy home. Her family was happy to see her safe. \"Thank you, Max,\" Luna purred. \"You are a good friend.\"\n\nMax wagged his tail. \"You're welcome, Luna. Anytime you need help, just call me.\"\n\nFrom that day on, Luna and Max played together in the garden every day. Luna was never scared again because she knew Max was her friend.\n\n**The End.**"}
