He had a big backyard with trees and flowers.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, Tom heard a soft \"meow.\" He looked around and saw a small, fluffy cat sitting near the fence. The cat had white fur and green eyes.\n\n\"Hello, little cat,\" said Tom. \"Are you lost?\"\n\nThe cat meowed again and rubbed against Tom's leg. Tom decided to help. He went inside and got a bowl of milk from the kitchen. He gave the milk to the cat. The cat drank happily.\n\nTom named the cat Snow. Every day, Snow would come to Tom's backyard. They played together, chased butterflies, and rested under the trees.\n\nOne day, Tom's mother saw Snow and smiled. \"You have a friend now,\" she said.\n\nTom was very happy. He had made a new friend. Tom and Snow continued to enjoy many happy days together in the village.\n\n**The End.**"}
